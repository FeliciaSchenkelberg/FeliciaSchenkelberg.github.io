							<p>Reverse engineering can be used to improve cloud-based information technology (IT) systems because it offers end-users computing control. In reverse engineering cloud-based IT systems end-users can recover the design, requirement specifications, and functions of the system from an analysis of the code. This is done for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to: coping with system complexity, detecting side effects, synthesizing higher abstraction, and facilitating reuse.</p>
							<p>The most effective advantage of reverse engineering is that it allows you, once you have broken the program down, to reassemble and patch it. To patch a file means to modify. An example of this may include changing the structure of the program thus affecting the program’s logical process. Patches allow engineers to add commands or change the behavior of each operation by inserting new snippets of code into the original code. This enables the ability to add, remove, or disable functions, and fix security vulnerabilities without the source code.</p>
							<p>There are numerous IoT devices already infected with malware because they lack even the most basic security practices, such as strong password authentication. Recent attacks on the internet of things by botnets have drawn attention to the fact that there are many more devices vulnerable to exploitation. This is because these internet-connected devices also lack basic security practices. Exposing them to the possibility of being attacked.</p>
							<p>Reverse engineering impacts new IT technologies, such as IoT and cloud computing, by introducing greater innovation. New and improved methods, ideas, and products. Users can learn a lot by breaking down IT technologies for inspection and then reassembling them. That is the concept behind reverse engineering. Breaking down and examining the construction of another program to understand and improve it. While security researchers reverse-engineer code to find security risks in programs. Threat actors also use this technique to understand applications and disrupt them.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ethical Hacking</h2>
								<p>Ethical hacking is a skill that is learned over time. It takes both practice and patience to reach the right level of proficiency. Having a lab "room" can greatly enhance your learning. A lab "room" allows you to practice your skills in a stable environment, reducing the risks of practicing on real systems.</p>
								<p>There are only two requirements for setting up this lab: Hardware and Software.</p>
								<p><ol>
									<li>Hardware</li>
									<ul>
										<li>A laptop or a desktop.</li>
										<li>A host OS for your computer system (Windows, Linux, or Mac OS).</li>
									</ul> 
									<li>Software</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Virtual Machine Player or Hypervisor.</li>
										<li>Guest Operating Systems: In this tutorial, I will be primarily discussing Windows.</li>
									</ul>
								  </ol></p>
								<p>Once you have found and installed your favorite vulnerable assets, it is now time to get the tools required for pwning them. Install these tools on your computer to get started.</p>
