								<p>Welcome, all!</p>
								<p>Ms. Schenkelberg is a cybersecurity consultant offering cybersecurity assessments, social engineering tests, pen-testing, vulnerability scanning, and in-depth strategic analysis based in Cleveland, Ohio. With working experience coordinating and administering the maintenance of security-related control systems, including anti-virus, firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, and secure web gateway. Ms. Schenkelberg has experience addressing both sides of organizational cybersecurity.</p>
								<p>The protection of corporate networks, equipment, and data while ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information is vital. With her extensive knowledge of incident response procedures and processes. She will help your organization design, deploy, monitor, and maintain devices, systems, applications, interconnections, and protocols for security, performance, inventory, compliance, logging, and alerting capabilities. All while ensuring the availability of systems for ongoing business operations.</p>

							<h2 class="major">Software Reverse Engineering</h2>
							<p>Software Reverse Engineering is a process of recovering the design, requirement specifications and functions of a product from an analysis of its code. 
								Security researchers reverse-engineer code to find security risks in programs. They also use the technique to understand malicious applications and disrupt them. 
								But researchers aren't the only ones doing this: bad actors also want to find software flaws through reverse engineering.</p>
							<p>Prior to this lesson, it was my understanding that security vulnerabilities were faults in information systems, programs, and applications that could be exploited by threat sources. I have since learned that security means that the system has the properties of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Additionally, users must be authenticated and authorized correctly. This leads me to the conclusion that security vulnerabilities are a deficiency of one or more of these properties: confidentiality, integrity, or availability which can allow threat sources to exploit the given information system, program, or application.</p>
							<p>As mentioned above, vulnerabilities are essentially faults in information systems, programs, or applications that compromise the security of a program. This can allow threat sources to exploit the system. In most cases, the kinds of vulnerabilities identifiable in C++ code are external. Meaning that they come from the outside world. This includes input such as files downloaded to the program or even data packets sent over a network. The idea is to provide unexpected program inputs to get the program to stray from its’ normal execution path. Two such examples of vulnerabilities include but are not limited to integer overflows and type conversion errors.</p>
							<p>I should be looking for vulnerabilities during legacy to C++ conversion rather than during testing, as it will be easier for me to secure the program. During testing, there are no ways to test for every possible code path for bugs and security holes (Microsoft, 2019). By looking for vulnerabilities during legacy to C++ conversion, I can easily express the architecture and design requirements of the application, maintain code optimization and efficiency, as well as ensure code security. In this way, I eliminate many faults on which many threat sources rely.</p>
							<p>One way to determine the appropriate fix for a security vulnerability is to use a threat modeling system, such as STRIDE. This acronym stands for “Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege” (Microsoft, 2019). To determine the appropriate fix, you must first decompose the system into relevant components. This is done to be able to analyze the threat sensitivity of each component and mitigate it.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Ethical Hacking</h2>
								<p>Ethical hacking is a skill that is learned over time. It takes both practice and patience to reach the right level of proficiency. Having a lab "room" can greatly enhance your learning. A lab "room" allows you to practice your skills in a stable environment, reducing the risks of practicing on real systems.</p>
								<p>There are only two requirements for setting up this lab: Hardware and Software.</p>
								<p><ol>
									<li>Hardware</li>
									<ul>
										<li>A laptop or a desktop.</li>
										<li>A host OS for your computer system (Windows, Linux, or Mac OS).</li>
									</ul> 
									<li>Software</li>
									<ul>
										<li>Virtual Machine Player or Hypervisor.</li>
										<li>Guest Operating Systems: In this tutorial, I will be primarily discussing Windows.</li>
									</ul>
								  </ol></p>
								<p>Once you have found and installed your favorite vulnerable assets, it is now time to get the tools required for pwning them. Install these tools on your computer to get started.</p>
